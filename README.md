## Advert Sales Prediction
### This repository contains a simple Python script for predicting sales based on advertising data using linear regression. The script uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning and seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
> Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

**pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn**
> You can install them using the following command:

```

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

```



## Data
### The project uses a CSV file named "Advert.csv" for the dataset. Ensure that the file is present in the same directory as the script.

## Results
### The script will output the Mean Squared Error and R-Squared values, providing insights into the accuracy of the linear regression model in predicting sales based on advertising features.

### **Feel free to modify and experiment with the script to enhance your understanding or adapt it for your specific needs.**
